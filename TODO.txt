THINGS TO CHECK MANUALLY:
correlation_lookup.py

THINGS TO THINK ABOUT:
hidden state not a parameter thus just have it as a parameter. How does gradient flow through GRU if not detached?

Add loss function class
Chain everything, add psnr loss and timings, run pretraining for a bunch of epochs on Monka opf dataset
